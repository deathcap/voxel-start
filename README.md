# voxel-start

Shows a start play button icon, until the user clicks the canvas to attain game interaction (voxel.js plugin)

The icon disappears and plugin self-disables once the user clicks, but it
is visible before then to signify to the user they should click to begin
(instead of a confusing mostly-blank screen).
